# theBritaProject

In our journey in the world of making we decided it's time we solve a common and sourios problem.
In my rented apartment I use a Brita pitcher for water filtering. As a result of me being lazy and forgetful i often find myself reaching for an empty pitcher. 
One day it hit me - I got to build an automated filling station for the pitcher. And if something worth doing - itâ€™s definitely worth overdoing - so we added IoT to the picture.
We decided to make this project as A Satirical tribute to the internet of everything. 

General feature: automated filling, pitcher out of station for too long mobile notification, water filling stat, filter replacement notification, drink some water reminder when the pitcher is in the base for too long.
